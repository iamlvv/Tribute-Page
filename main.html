                Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty (born December 8, 1982), known professionally as Nicki Minaj (/mɪˈnɑːʒ/), 
                is a Trinidadian-born[a] rapper, singer, and songwriter. She is known for her animated flow in her 
                rapping and versatility as an artist.
                Born in the Saint James district of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago and raised in Queens of New York City, 
                she gained public recognition after releasing the mixtapes Playtime Is Over (2007), Sucka Free (2008), and
                Beam Me Up Scotty (2009). Early in her career, Minaj became known for her colorful costumes and wigs, her 
                distinct flow, and the use of alter egos and accents, primarily British cockney.

                Onika Tanya Maraj was born in the Saint James district of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, 
                on December 8, 1982.[8][9] Her father was Robert Maraj (1956-2021),[10] a financial executive and 
                part-time gospel singer of Dougla (Afro-Trinidadian mother and Indo-Trinidadian father) descent.[11] 
                Her mother, Carol Maraj, is also a gospel singer with Afro-Trinidadian ancestry.[12] 
                Carol worked in payroll and accounting departments during Minaj's youth.[13][14] Minaj's father was addicted to 
                alcohol and crack cocaine[15] and had a violent temper, burning down their house in December 1987.[16] She has an
                 older brother named Jelani, a younger brother named Micaiah, and a younger sister named Ming.

                <p>
                    Minaj briefly signed with Brooklyn group Full Force, in which she rapped in a quartet called 
                    The Hoodstars composed of Lou$tar (son of "Bowlegged Lou"), Safaree Samuels (Scaff Beezy) 
                    and 7even Up.[22][23] In 2004, the group recorded the entrance song for WWE Diva Victoria, 
                    "Don't Mess With", which was featured on the compilation album ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, 
                    Vol.6. Minaj later left Full Force and uploaded songs on her Myspace profile, sending several 
                    of her songs to people in the music industry. Later, Fendi, CEO of Brooklyn label Dirty Money 
                    Entertainment, signed Minaj to his label in 2007 under a 180-day contract.[24] Originally adopting 
                    the stage name Nicki Maraj, she eventually changed it to Nicki Minaj stating that "my real name is 
                    Maraj. Fendi flipped it when he met me because I had such a nasty flow!"[25]

                    Minaj released her first mixtape, Playtime Is Over, on July 5, 2007,[26] and her second, 
                    Sucka Free, on April 12, 2008.[27] That year, she was named Female Artist of the Year at the 
                    2008 Underground Music Awards.[28] She released her third mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty, on April 18, 
                    2009;[29] it received favorable coverage on BET and MTV.[30][31] At the time, she was managed by 
                    Debra Antney. One of its tracks, "I Get Crazy", reached number 20 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Rap 
                    Songs chart and number 37 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[32] After Minaj was discovered by 
                    fellow rapper Lil Wayne,[33] in August 2009 it was reported that she signed a recording contract 
                    with his Young Money Entertainment.[34] That November, she appeared with Gucci Mane and Trina on 
                    the remix of "5 Star Bitch" by Yo Gotti.[35]

                    In October, Minaj was featured on Kanye West's "Monster", with her verse receiving acclaim and 
                    many critics regarding it as the best verse; The Village Voice's Sean Fennessey stated that 
                    "Monster" was the track that announced Minaj's "brilliance" to most people.[52] Complex rated 
                    Minaj's "Monster" verse as the number-one best rap verse in the past five years.[53] Lauren 
                    Nostro of Complex wrote: "Once the beat drops, we meet the many faces of Nicki Minaj. [...] 
                    Her performance has the power, years after its release, makes you stop dead in your tracks. 
                    Altering her vocal style on every line, she bounces her wordplay from Giuseppe Zanotti shoes 
                    to Tony Matterhorn's "Dutty Wine" to suggesting a ménage à trois with Kanye and his then-girlfriend 
                    Amber Rose. [...] It was clear, she did her thing alongside the best in the game—she stole the show, 
                    in fact, outshined them all." In November 2010, Minaj received her first Grammy Award nomination for 
                    her guest verse on Ludacris' song "My Chick Bad".[54]

                <p>
                    Minaj began her headlining Pink Friday Tour on May 16, 2012,[97] which was followed by the 
                    Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour beginning October 14, 2012.[98] Although she was scheduled to headline 
                    the June 3 Hot 97 Summer Jam at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, at the request of Lil Wayne she 
                    canceled her appearance the day of the show after Peter Rosenberg of the station dismissed her 
                    single "Starships" as "not real hip-hop".[99]

                    Minaj's first live-action theatrical film The Other Woman was filmed in spring 2013 and 
                    premiered on April 25, 2014.[111] She played Lydia, assistant to Carly (played by Cameron Diaz)
                    .[112][113] In 2013, Minaj described her then-forthcoming third album, The Pinkprint, as "a 
                    continuation of The Re-Up with a lot more" and said it would focus on her "hip-hop roots".[114][115] 
                    During an MTV interview, she said that her third album would be "next level" and that she has 
                    "much to talk about".[116]

                <span>2018–2019: Queen</span>
                <p>
                    Minaj announced her fourth album, Queen, on the red carpet at the 2018 Met Gala; the album was 
                    scheduled to be released on June 15, 2018,[157] but was delayed multiple times before being 
                    released on August 10, 2018.[158][159][160] Its lead single, "Chun-Li", was released on April 12, 
                    2018, and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100.[161] She performed the song on Saturday 
                    Night Live and the 2018 BET Awards.[162][163] Another single, "Barbie Tingz", was released alongside 
                    "Chun-Li", but did not make the final album cut. It is, however, included on the Target version 
                    of the album.[164] Queen's second single, "Bed", featuring Ariana Grande, was released on June 14, 
                    2018, alongside the album pre-order, and peaked at number 42 on the Hot 100.[165][166][167] On 
                    July 22, 2018, Tekashi 6ix9ine's single "Fefe", which featured Minaj, was released and debuted at 
                    number four on the Billboard Hot 100.[168] "Fefe" marked Minaj's highest bow on the chart as a 
                    featured artist at the time, besting the sixth place start of "Bang Bang" in 2014.[169] It later 
                    peaked at number three on the Hot 100,[168] and was added to Queen in the middle of its first 
                    tracking week.[170]
